Create Graphs, v 2.0
===========
filename: creatgraph_v2.py

This script creates a dynamic 1-mode digraph from Twitter.com messages.

HOW TO USE:
This program accepts three arguments: the input filename, the output filename,
and a time argument (integer representing the number of hours)

Example: python readtweetsml_v2.py inputfilenamehere.csv outputfilenamehere.txt 3

INPUT:
a csv file with three columns Date, Tweet content, username
Example: 
"Fri, 08 Jan 2012, 13:22:45 +0000","RT@cnn @johndoe Protest in Egypt #jan25","username@twitter.com (Authorname)"

The "date" field is formatted as: DoW, dd MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS +0000
+0000 refers to the timezone
The message field can contain any characters allowed by Twitter, as well as Retweets and
Tweet-ats and Hash-tags. RT@ (or "RT @") represents a Retweet; @ a tweet-at; and # a hashtag.

The R script CollectTweets.r (see, also: http://www.russellshepherd.com/d/?q=blog/replacing-twapperkeeper-r)
will collect Twitter data in this format automatically, for any given hashtag.


OUTPUT:
The script creates a 1-mode digraph of Twitter users where an edge exists if:
  1. The author includes tweet-at to another user. A directed tie is create from the
     author to the mentioned user.
  
  OR,

  2. The author includes a retweet from the original author of a message. In this case, a
     directed tie is create from user mentioned in the re-tweet to the author.

For example, the tweet "RT@cnn @johndoe Protest in Egypt #jan25" by user1 would create
two ties:
1. From user1 to johndoe
2. From cnn to user1

The graph is output in two files:
1. A static (no time data) edgelist ending in .txt
2. A dynamic (nodes and edges have lifespans, see "Time" below) gexf format file. See http://gexf.net for more info.

TIME:
Call the script with the third argument (an integer) to use time values:
Any integer greater than "0" (zero) X, defines the edge to exist from the start time
provide by Twitter (t1) to t1 + X.
For example, consider a tweet from user A to user B at 01:33:33 +0000:
If you call the script with "3" as the value for the optional third argument,
that tie will exist from A to B from 01:33:33 +0000 to 03:33:33 +0000.

CHANGE LOG:

Version 1.2 to 2.0:
  1. Dynamic graph output in gexf format.
  2. Automatically duplicate tweets (by indentifying identical entries, and only using one).


Verion 1.0 to 1.2: 
  1. Update to work with tweets which spanned multiple lines (e.g., contained newline characters).
  2. Accepts timestamps as generated by the Twitter Search API
